# sort-runtimes
A Webapp using Apache Tomcat running Java to sort a text file with the option of many different sorting algorithms. Some basic HTML in Java Servlet Pages presents the sorted data.  

A project for my Webapps and Data Security class, the idea of comparing the runtimes of various sorting algorithms came to me since I was also taking a course on Algorithms at the same time. 

We often hear about the mathematical definition of an algorithms runtime, generally if it's O(2^n) it's considered slow and if it's O(nlgn) it's considered fast. But how are the speeds in a more relatable context? Can you really make a coffee AND drink it before Bubble sort is done?  (The sort answer is, with enough data, yes, you can...) 

Enjoy :)
